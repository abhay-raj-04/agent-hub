# API Journeyman V4: The Integration Co-Pilot

This AI agent acts as an expert partner for integrating third-party services into your existing codebase. It understands your project's language and structure, analyzes the service you want to add, and provides context-aware guidance and code generation.

## Key Features

*   **Project-Awareness:** Scans your local project folder to understand its language, frameworks, and coding patterns.
*   **Interactive Folder Selection:** Browse and select your project folder using an intuitive file dialog, or enter the path manually.
*   **Smart Folder Exclusion:** Exclude unnecessary folders (like `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.git`) from analysis with one-click toggles.
*   **Autonomous Service Analysis:** Automatically finds and analyzes API documentation for any service, just from its name.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Concurrently analyzes your project and the service documentation for faster results.
*   **Interactive Guidance:** Presents a summary of its findings and lets you choose your next step.
*   **Multi-Language, Contextual Code Generation:** Generates code that matches your project's style and provides instructions on where to place it.
*   **Enhanced UI Experience:** Modern, intuitive interface with progress indicators, validation, and helpful examples.
